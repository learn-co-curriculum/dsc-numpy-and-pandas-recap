# NumPy and Pandas - Recap

This short lesson summarizes the topics we covered in this section and why they'll be important to you as a Data Scientist.

## Introduction

In this section, we spent time getting comfortable with NumPy and Pandas and started practicing essential ETL (extract, transform, load) skills that you will use throughout your data work to transform and wrangle data into useful forms.

## Key Takeaways

 - For non-trivial datasets you'll usually want to store your data in **Pandas data structures** (`Series` and `DataFrame` objects) — which are built on top of NumPy data structures — rather than native Python lists and dictionaries
 - Pandas has a range of great features for **easily importing data** from anything from a CSV, an Excel file, JSON, or a Python dictionary
 - Pandas also has a range of methods for applying **descriptive statistics** to `Series` and `DataFrame` objects
 - Finally, Pandas `Series` and `DataFrame` objects have a bunch of **powerful methods for munging data** (applying functions, combining datasets, grouping and aggregating, creating pivot tables, handling missing data)

## Summary

Wrangling and cleaning data in Pandas will be a baseline skill that you will use consistently in your work whether it's doing sanity checks, cleaning messy data, or transforming raw datasets into useful aggregates and views. Having an understanding of the format of your data is essential to critically thinking about how you can manipulate and shape it into new and interesting forms.
